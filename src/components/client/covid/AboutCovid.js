          Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough,
          shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases,
          infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome,
          kidney failure and even death.The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly
          transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs,
          sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air,
          and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.You can be infected by
          breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone
          who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your
          eyes, nose or mouth.If you feel sick you should rest, drink plenty of
          fluid, and eat nutritious food. Stay in a separate room from other
          family members, and use a dedicated bathroom if possible. Clean and
          disinfect frequently touched surfaces.Everyone should keep a healthy
          lifestyle at home. Maintain a healthy diet, sleep, stay active, and
          make social contact with loved ones through the phone or internet.
          Children need extra love and attention from adults during difficult
          times. Keep to regular routines and schedules as much as possible.It
          is normal to feel sad, stressed, or confused during a crisis. Talking
          to people you trust, such as friends and family, can help. If you feel
          overwhelmed, talk to a health worker or counsellor.
